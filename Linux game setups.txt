BASE WINE PREFIX SETUP

wine and winetricks

sudo winetricks --self-update

winetricks dxvk vkd3d

run winecfg and in libraries add: dinput8 and d3d8 as native, builtin (needed for older games)

here you can find a list of those games that need more stuff to be fixed

DEDICATED PREFIXES AND OVERRIDES SETUP:

Use ASG Script from my repo, it will automatically handle wine overrides and arguments for games that need them.

Overrides are written in this document for documentation purposes.



CONTROLLER SETUP (If using a non XInput controller):

install xboxdrv, if using a dualsense use ds360 wrapper. Compile it with make and run the executable.

The controller tester should report the controller as "Xbox 360 controller":

https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad



SPECIFIC GAME SETUPS:


Assetto Corsa


1) Install from Steam in a EXT4 partition with proton 5.0.x in compatibilty settings

2) run once

3) use protonUpQT and install protonGE for steam, reboot steam and change compat for the game to ProtonGE

4) run assetto corsa again.


ADD CONTENT MANAGER SUPPORT

Install the content manager by following their guide, rename AssettoCorsa.exe with any name.

then: ln "Content Manager.exe" AssettoCorsa.exe to replace the main executable with the manager


then go into SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/244210/pfx/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/config/

make a symlink towards the steam login file, so the manager can see the logged users in steam:

ln -s "/home/username/.steam/root/config/loginusers.vdf" .  where the dot is the current game directory where the manager is.


CUSTOM SHADER PATCH SUPPORT:

winecfg through protontricks:

protontricks 244210 winecfg


in "Libraries" add: dwrite (native, builtin)


run the manager, give to it the game path, username and install FBX and 7zip plugins

to install the shader patch drag & drop the archive in the manager UI.


If there are UI glitches disable hardware acceleration from the manager UI.

DON'T FULL SCREEN THE CONTENT MANAGER OR IT WILL FREEZE
