NOTE: some old games might work better on HDDrather than SSD.

This document shows how to setup properly the games before running the script that will generate the shell runners.

Here are specified what patches are needed, fixes and so on for some games.

Ignore the DLLOVERRIDES, WINETRICKS and PREFIX tips, those are already integrated in the script.

so basically just apply the patches/fixes for controllers, widescreens ecc and then the script will allow you to apply
fixes for those individual games that need it. The specific games are listed in the UI of the generator so you will know
what game will need it.

Also, some games are pretty old and do not have controller support, for now i've suggested only a couple of antimicroX profiles to play with them.

apply the controller fix, get it from here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/14lU8WITCHfYBpyuVO3Uoy9Ql-JJcwbka/view

remove systemdetection.dll, run the game from conviction_game.exe for the first time, ignore the detection error message

close the game. then go into your prefix path:

prefix/drive_c/ProgramData/Ubisoft/Conviction/

open file ConvictionUserPC.ini

find:

[Inputs]
ControllerType=KT_xxx (if you use a logitech controller you will find KT_LOGITECH)

change with KT_X360

in game set refresh rate to 60Hz, some decorative objects like flags have broken physics if above 60Hz

to fix audio stutter and crackling:

WINEPREFIX="/path/to/used/prefix" wine taskmgr

service tab and find conviction_game.exe

set CPU affinity to all the cores you have

NOTE: unfortunately the game forces its affinity to 1 core every time we load a level or we go back to the main menu

i still have to find a way to set the affinity to all cores ever x minutes without booting the game again.
